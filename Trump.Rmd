## Introduction

In this analysis, we wanted to determine the impact of Trump's tweets on various financial markets and economic indicators. Specifically, we wanted to determine the impacts of Trump tweets in relation to the recent United States - China trade war. 

## Synopsis

To do this, we obtained the tweet data from the official Trump Twitter account @realDonaldTrump, filtered to include only tweets with the word 'Trade' included. We wanted to determine the following questions through our analysis:

1. Is there a relationship between Trump Trade tweets and the stock market?
2. Is there a relationship between Trump Trade tweets on the bond markets?
3. Is there a relationship between Trump Trade tweets on various economic indicators?
  
To do this, we compared the data from January 2016 through September 2019 for the fields listed in the Data section below.

## Data Wrangling
Sources of Data
We obtained our data from the following sources:
 
1. Trump 'Trade' Twitter Data: This data was obtained from the @realDonaldTrump account using a Twitter querying tool at the following web address http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/archive. In order to verify the accuracy of the tweets queried, we selected a sample of tweets to validate on Twitter.
2. Gold: Nasdaq website
3. 10-year: FRED website
4. GDP: FRED website
5. GNP: FRED Website
6. 2-year: FRED website
7. Oil: FRED Website
8. DJIA: FRED Website
9. COffee: FRED Website
10. 30-year: FRED Website
11. Business Confidence Index: FRED Website
12. Consumer COnfidence Index: FRED Website

## Cleaning the data and creating the Dataframe

In order to analyze the data, we had to convert the data into a common frequency as some of the data was monthly, daily, etc. We determined the ideal timeframe to analyze our data by month because most economic data is reported monthly, and this would give us enough observations to conduct our analysis.

The resulting dataframe included the time period as the primary field (Month-Date), the number of Trump 'Trade' Tweets in the month, and monthly economic data for each of the indicators in our dataframe.

## Results

1. Is there a relationship between Trump Trade tweets and the stock market?
The relationship tends to be positive in regards to the S&P500. However, we observe a decreasing marginal impact as number of tweets increase. 

2. Is there a relationship between Trump Trade tweets on the bond markets?
As the number of years to maturity on the bonds increase, the less effect Trump's tweets have. We see that the 2-year bonds have a steeper postivie relationship as tweets increase per month adversely to 30-year bonds being flat and having no relationship.

3. Is there a relationship between Trump Trade tweets on various economic indicators?
Relationships between the number of tweets and economic indicators vary. However, all of these economic indicators have a positive relationship with smaller number of tweets and then become flatter as the volume of tweets increases. 

For future researchers who wish to continue researching this topic, we recommend the following improvements to our project:

1. Include additional economic indicators such as export data (only reported quarterly), etc.
2. Develop more robust econometric models to determine relationships between the number of tweets and economic indicators
3. Multivariable regressions, time series analysis, adjusting for seasonality, detrending, randomness, etc.

There was a small count of observations in which Trump tweeted a high volume of Tweets in a given month. This caused the variance with other variable to be higher when the number of tweets was larger.
